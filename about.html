            We are currently working on structurally two different, but highly related, projects regarding algorithmic trading and automation.

                <u>Purpose</u>
                <p>
                    Manual trading is a risky but potentially lucrative field in which one can buy/sell securities, usually with relatively short holding periods, to profit from rapid price fluctuations. However, it is widely known that in addition to using, creating, and combining smart techniques and strategies, consistency and lack of emotion are key components to being profitable. This is one of the main reasons why so many new traders lose their savings. To combat this, we propose an automated solution.

                <u>Summary</u>
                <p>
                    This proposal involves building a modular but highly extensive and flexible codebase to allow for easily creating, adding, backtesting, and the real-time running of trading algorithms, based on already existent or custom indicators. While this alone will eliminate factors such as emotion based decisions and cognitive trading biases, another equally important feature of this codebase would be the ability to build and customize our own dynamic risk-management systems, which will manage position sizes based on entry price, stop-loss, total liquidity, desired percentage of capital risked, and win rate. Implementing a system of this nature would help protect capital and optimize algorithms’ results.
